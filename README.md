# temp_git_config_shell_script
Script to create an alias to make it easy to flip to a temporary git user on a repo. Just run it and specify the filepath and the username/email for git to use. Afterwards, just type 'gitchange' in a repo and it will automatically configure it with the pre-specified temporary user.
